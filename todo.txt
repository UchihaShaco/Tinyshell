Redirection rules
-in general, the last input and last output are given to the cmd
-output 
	if both > and >> are present and point to the same file, > takes precedence not matter the order
-input 
	all files are opened even if they are not the final input
	if both < and << are present, the last one will be counted as the file - they can point to the same "filename" because << points to a delimiter rather than a file
Finalize data
.1. modify cmd
	-modify char **file
	-modify int *redir
	-create char **hd_array
	-create int count_hd
	-create int record_hd
	-create int *fd_array
	-create int last_output
	-create int_last_input
	-create char *path

FILES added:
mod_cmd.c
utils_h.c
free.c

NOTES to discuss: 
-ts_malloc.c -> this can probably be reduced to one function -> see ft_calloc_e
-ts_cound_and_record_cmd.c -> if you use calloc, no need to intialize to NULL and 0 (tcmd){}
